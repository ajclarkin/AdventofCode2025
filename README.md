# AdventofCode2025
There are only 12 days of Christmas this year so I would imagine progress will be even shorter than usual...

***

1. Modular arithmetic, floor division
2. String slicing, indexing, and comparison
3. Ordering and searching lists, joining characters
4. 2D map adjacencies, working on list copy
5. Combinations, ranges of numbers, intersecting ranges
6. Column-wise data input. Removing last character or word.
